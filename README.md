Notes on code:

FridayProj1upd:
        Input Collection:

        Each input() function prompts the user to enter a specific type of word. The results are stored in variables for later use in the story.
        large_object, large_objects_plural, adjective, body_part, restaurant, first_food, and second_food are variables that hold the user inputs.
    Creating the Mad Lib Story:

        A multiline formatted string (mad_lib_story) is created using f-strings. This allows for easy insertion of user inputs into the predefined story.
        The \n is used to add line breaks in the story for better readability.
    Displaying the Result:

        The final story is printed out with a  descriptive message to inform the user that their Mad Lib is ready.
